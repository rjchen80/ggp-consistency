### Install
This repo has been developed and tested on Python 3.10. The requirements file `requirements.txt` includes all package dependencies which can be installed by, e.g., `pip` (including the [GPy library](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) for GP utilities).

### How to run
To reproduce experiments on convergence results, as well as the counter-example experiment under violated assumptions, run the python script: `LfRmse.py`.
